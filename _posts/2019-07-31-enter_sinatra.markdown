The past couple of weeks of learning how to code basic web apps through Sinatra have been jarring to say the least. Going from the simple action of inspecting and scraping HTML, to writing my own HTML has been an engaging challenge, however it is incredibly satisfying to see new concepts building on the old, through combining Sinatra with ActiveRecord, and object oriented Ruby. Additionally, I have found that terms that I have heard all of my life while browsing the webm such as "cookies" have taken on a whole new meaning for me. Until now, the only time I cared to know what a "cookie" was outside of a bakery was to clear the cookies in my browser as a rudimentary solution to some web surfing problem I had encounted. In the Sessions subsection of the Sinatra section of the curriculum, learning that a cookie is user data stored in a hash in the browser has given me a new way of looking at websites, and the frameworks within them. As I move on to using Sinatra with ActiveRecord, and get closer and closer to project week, I am excited to build a web application of my own, to apply these new findings.
